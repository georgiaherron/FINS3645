# Flux

Flux is an automated investment advice tool that uses machine learning (ML) to generate portfolio recommendations for investors. Flux recommendations are based on a broad spectrum of market and sentiment indicators, news and heterogeneous data streams. It can provide customers with valuable, data-based insights, with the main feature of portfolio optimisation, based on Modern Portfolio Theory. Flux aims to provide customers with valuable data-based insights, that help them make more informed investment decisions, minimise risk and maximise returns.


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Flux. The Python codes that are required to run Flux are found in the folder that was sent via [OneDrive](https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/z5060047_ad_unsw_edu_au/EnMGb8osMd1Flowb2KGfpmwBfzz8RUyVWRU-C0mChXRj-A?e=X0lSWg). 
The core files containing the code are PortfolioAnalysis.py and SentimentAnalysis.py. 

(Please note, I tried to build an application that ran a dashboard on Heroku, however I ran out of time... This was called 'FluxApp.py' and hence why the README file installation instructions (below) say run it as a command. This runs true for the requirements.txt file. I was unable to test it fully because I could not get the final Python file (the app) working. Sorry about this! Also, this code was tested only on Python 3.9.6.).

To run Flux, please run the following commands:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt 

python3 FluxApp.py
